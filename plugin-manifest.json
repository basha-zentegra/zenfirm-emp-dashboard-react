Possible Use Cases: 

1) Proper Data
IN TIME	OUT TIME
09:05	10:05
10:10	11:00


2) Still not checked out
IN TIME	OUT TIME
09:05	"-"


3) Mistakenly Two times checked in
IN TIME	OUT TIME
09:05	"-"
09:06	10:05
10:10	11:00

4) Mistakenly Two times checked out
IN TIME	OUT TIME
09:05	10:05

Note: the checkin checkou data is single employee's records only, 
and the data is provided in the proper order based on punch in time,

Formula to arrange the double check in and check outs:
If while looping the records e.Check Sholuld contains Alternate data like IN, OUT, IN, OUT (Correct order)
if the order changes like IN, IN, OUT, IN, OUT, IN, OUT (or) IN, OUT, IN, OUT, OUT, IN, OUT --> double IN or OUT continuesly comes we need to keep the duplicated IN or OUT as seprate record as per the about mentioned usecase
